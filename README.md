# KNIME_project
Animal Shelter Outcome classification.
This was part of my advanced business analytics course final project.

The dataset was from an animal shelter and task was to design a workflow to predict the outcome for the animal.

Model prototype creation using KNIME workflow to predict the outcome (classification problem) for an animal being administered in the shelter.

-Lifecycle of the project:
1. Preprocessing of the raw data and initial key insights report.
2. Extracting relevant feature and new feature generation.
3. Handling of class imbalance was done using SMOTE to oversample under represented class.
4. Model selection - Random forest was selected after comparing the results of Decision Tree, Naive bayes.
5. Cross validation for the hyper-parameter tuning.
Application:- The created model can be used for prediction of most severe cases like euthanasia and death with highest accuracy.

To view the model would require the KNIME tool, can be download from: https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform
